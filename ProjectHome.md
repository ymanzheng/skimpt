=Program UPDATED to 3.0.0 // Beta1
## March6th 2010 ##
### Please update ASAP ###

## Description ##

Developed with the dot net framework, this application allows you to take a screenshot of your desktop/current window. Features include automatic timers, uploading to the internet, image effects, photoshop support, explorer menus, and much more!

## First Time Setup ##
Download the setup project and install the program. After installing, it will ask you two main questions that the program requires. The first is an API key from http://www.imgur.com. (http://imgur.com/register/api/). It will also ask you for a default location for your files. This will probably be your "My Pictures" folder. After that your program is ready and set to go!

## How To Use ##
Well, the simplest way to use is to press the print screen button on your computer. This will take a full screen shot and put it in memory (not saved to hard disk yet). It will launch the image processing screen:

You can choose to apply an image effect on it (I only have three for now). Or you can press "to site" and it will upload to imgur.com.

### Camera/Highlight Mode ###
Right click the little icon and select Camera mode. This allows you to take a specific size picture of your screen.  It looks like this:

When you press print screen, it allows you to select the area. To capture that area, press print screen again. You are again presented with the default image processing screen that you can use to apply effects/upload

## Image Processing Screen ##
This screen allows you to work with your image. It has two textboxes, one for your file location and the other for the uploaded image URL.

  * Pause timer: This pauses the timer that the screen uses. By default it is set to 10. That mean ten seconds. You can go into options and change it to any multiple of 5 you want up to a minute.

  * Save image: This button is self-explanatory. If the file already exists it creates a 5 letter hash and adds --skimpt at the end of the file name.

  * Optimize before save/upload: If this is checked, any action (save/upload) will result in the image being formed as a jpeg. If this is unchecked it will result in the image encoded as a png.

## Photoshop Support ##
Right click a PSD format file. Click skimpt. You are presented with the image processing screen. You may save it as a jpeg/png or upload it. **PHOTOSHOP NOT REQUIRED**
